How this app helps?

    * The app regularly tracks wheather your are free or addicted.
    * It calculates how long your are free or how long you didn't repeat the behaviour.
    * Once you relapsed, The time starts from 0.
    * Positive effects, Side effects and Steps to overcome compulsions can be noted.
    * They can be edited in the same app.
    * As a reward, whenever you didn't relapse, A song or part of it starts playing.
    * To use a part of a song, search "<song name> or <favourite line> ringtone" in google.
